Here's a potential new year's resolution: write a blog post every week. I've
lost my momentum on this blog. Given my track record I wouldn't hold my breath,
but I'll see what I can do.

## 2022 Review in Photos

Here we are hiking up Pasochoa looking out at Cotopaxi.

Here we are on the Quilatoa loop, backpacking and passing an alpaca.

Afterwards we went to Baños, a town between the mountains of Ecuador and the
Amazon.

Once our "week off" was over, it was back to working out of Nayon. One day we
went to Cumbaya, another suburb of Quito, and climbed and got beers.

We went up to the town of Otavalo which has a weekly market to buy some
souvenirs, eat some good food, and get some cool hikes in.

We went back to the school Mattie had taught english in in Nayon and taught a
class.

Then for a brief stop in the USA, we went to Georgia for Amanda (Mattie's
cousing) and Shane's wedding.

Less that 72 hours later we were back in Mexico. Here we are in Teotihuacan
(above) and a restaurant in a cave just outside the landmark (below).
