The plan for this summer is to road trip around and do adventures in cool
places. When I flew back to the mainland, no sooner had I landed in Seattle then
I was on the road heading for Bend, OR. I took a conference call from the
car--Zoom virtual backgrounds somehow made it look like I was in an office with
just a little hint of a seatbelt on my shoulder.

We landed in Terrebonne (north of Bend and adjacent to our target: Smith Rock)
and stayed with a friend of Mattie's, Em. I finished out my friday working from
her house then met up Mattie and her friends in Bend. Saturday was a big day of
climbing.

We did two multipitches (climbs that take place over several pieces) and were
starting on a third when it started to rain and we had to bail--after helping
out a group that had forgotten to untie the stopper knot in their rope before
pulling down their top-rope. Sunday was a good exercise in bringing ropes and
other climbing gear to the wall as we attempted the same climb that we had the
day before and got rained out again. We had a nice evening in Bend and on Monday
after work tried a new climb.

This one had a hell of a long approach hike in the hot sun but amazing climbing
and stellar views of Smith from the top. While it was twilight by the time we
were crossing the stream to get back to the car, it was hot enough I jumped in
the river anyway. Tuesday after work we took another crack at Dirty Pinkos (the
climb we'd been rained out of twice), the third time proved the charm and we
completed the climb.

We then headed to Boise where we visited my godparents Drew and Sheri. We had a
couple nice days in Boise and a lovely dinner. It was great to see Drew and
Sheri and we'll have to visit again because we missed their kids Heidi and Fred.
Boise has not 1, not 2, but 3 [citation needed] man made surf waves in the
river. We went and watched people surfing and it looked pretty cool. We also
checked out several of Boise's cool parks and the Anne Frank memorial.

After that we headed to City of Rocks for the weekend. We managed to cram a
bunch of climbing in.

Rye Crisp was particularly interesting because we didn't have the right gear to
protect it--a good crack running up the whole way, but so wide that it took all
of the big cams and we ran out. Mattie had to do a fair amount of back cleaning
and got so exhausted running up and down it cleaning it that I ended up having
to finish the route.
