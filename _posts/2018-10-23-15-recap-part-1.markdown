My last few months have been a little more complicated than usual. Rather than
just writing a single post to summarize everything I've been up to I'm going to
try to break things down into more manageable chucks so that I actually have a
chance of actually following through and talking about it.

Here's a brief sketch of what I've been up to:

  1. Mei's birthday + Daniel and Alyssa's wedding. I think I've already talked about
     this.
  2. Couch surfing
  3. Kansas City
  4. Shane Shoemaker's Wedding
  5. Flight into the UK (spoiler alert, lost bag was the least of my worries)
  6. Brussels & AutoSens
  7. UK Visa fun (I sort of got kicked out)
  8. UK Adventures (Bees, soap festival, Wales, Edinburgh)
  9. Spain!

I'll see if I can get through about 2-4 in this post.

Following Mei and Nick finally returning to tropical paradise and parental politics,
I decided it was high time to visit friends down in Salt Lake. This started with a
visit to Daniel James, a good friend of mine from college (uni for any international
readers I may have picked up). I remember playing board games, playing rock band,
(where I sung "What's Up" to everyone's chagrin), and swimming in the pool.

I also ended up at some interviews that had sought me out. One was actually pretty
interesting and would have involved working for a SF software company that was building
a presence in Salt Lake. I would have been sorely tempted to actually take the job had
an offer actually been given, but somewhere along the line I lost contact with them.
I'm not actually sure what happened. The other was a lesson in not taking random interviews
even if you just want to practice your interviewing skills. It was not at all what I
thought it would be, and it basically amounted to a sales position.

That done I went and stayed with Jared and Shannon for a couple of days which was a really
good time. I'm blending the time flow here a little bit, but at some point we ended up
on a spontaneous trip to Southern Utah and another we ended up
hiking Bridal Veil Falls in Provo Canyon. Bridal Veil was a third choice
after discovering that the Flow Rider in Ogden was incredibly crowded
(something I still have some paid for rides on left and which I'd done with Mei and Nick
while they were still in town). The second choice was to try to float in tubes down the
Provo River. something we missed by a couple minutes. It was still a really cool experience.

Other Salt Lake adventures involved going country dancing with Devinie and checking out her
new apartment and visiting Dave's new place. I also caught up with Trevor, Brody, and Dustin
at their new house in Sugar House (a region in Salt Lake City).

Somewhere in this span of time I flew out to Kansas City to visit Juju in her new apartment.
Unfortunately she was terribly sick when I saw her but it was still cool to see where she's
living, check out a new city, and eat some delicious BBQ food. Maybe next time I'll finally
get to meet her new boyfriend.

This gets us to mid september where I went to Shane's Wedding. Shane "Shoe" Shoemaker is a
friend of mine from college and was one of the two main founders of the Utah Chapter of
Triangle Fraternity. As much as I tried to get the nickname Show to catch on, everyone in that
friend group still calls him "Big Shane" and me "Little Sheyne". The wedding added to the fun because
there was a third Shane which we were all calling "Naked Shane"--odd because that seems like
such a Shoe thing to earn as a nickname.

Shoe decided it'd be fun to have a big chuck of the wedding party go canyoneer Spry canyon.
If you want to hear deatails, ask me about 18 of us going through it, but I'm not emotionally
ready to spend too many words on it. It was fun and very draining.

The wedding itself was great. I got to see tons of friends I hadn't seen in ages, although I
did have to leave relatively early. I think we left Zion between 9pm and 10pm and made it to
Salt Lake by around 3am. I'm not sure how the math works out there because it shouldn't have
taken nearly that long so maybe my memory is just exaggerating. I did have to get up at like
4 am that morning for a 6am flight to San Francisco.
