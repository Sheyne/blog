Hi everyone,

It's been a minute hasn't it. As is tradition, I'm on a flight (OGG->SFO) returning from the most last minute trip
of my life. If I remember right, I heard it might be good if I came out Tuesday at 3, by 6 I had tickets and was
scrambling to get a train to LA.

So a couple weeks ago I caught a ride up with Juli Ann to Sacremento. I got a change to see Yenna (hi Yenna, I
hope that you're reading), Roxane, Adam, and the newest member of the family, Biscuit! Roxane and Adam adopted
a corgi puppy who's just a couple of weeks old (follow her on Instgram at @bigworldlittlebiscuit, because, of
course they made an Instagram). While I was up there, I got a chance to see Chip and Annie who were just coming
back from their honeymoon all over Italy and through the Netherlands.
