First of all, apparently I don't know how to spell British. I think I've got it now,
but I shutter to think of the number of times I've spelled it with two 't's. 

I'm not sure how much of this I've already talked about, but did you know the Brits are 
switch crazy. Look at this:

Each wall outlet has a switch for every socket. Additionally, there's a switch to
even enable the stove top (which then of course has nobs to control the burners
individually).

Then we have the combined washing/drying machine. Mine's actually in the closet 
with the water heater, but they're apparently normally found in the kitchen.

I like the utilitarian idea of having one machine that performs both functions, 
but as one expatriate on the internet remarked, the drying mode really doesn't do
anything. 

On the other hand, this thing in the bathrooms is amazing!

It can be switched on (from outside the bathroom of course, none of the bathroom 
switches, including the lights are in the bathroom) and becomes a towel warmer.
I used it to top off my clothes and let them dry a bit more. It seems like if I 
have the presence of mind to turn it on before a shower, it will be the most 
amazing thing.
