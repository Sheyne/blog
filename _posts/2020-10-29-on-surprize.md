Information theory 

This idea has been bouncing around my head about travelling and growth and
expectations. Information theory talks about the amount of information carried by
a message is proportional to how surprizing it is. And while the analogy doesn't
really work, its a good metaphor where we learn more about when we're surprised
then when what expect to happen happens. We build a model of the world and we
refine it when we detect its wrong. Anyway, this keeps happening with my trip.
