So while Sean, Delia, and I were in Norway, on the first night, we walked around the city.
There was this park with all kinds of weird sculptures and are installations. Here's a photo
of be being mauled by a vicious rabbit.

The next day we went to several museums in Olso. The folk museum which had tons of
or Norwegian buildings from the ancient times to the present. It was an incredibly cool
place to walk through. Note the cool sod roofing.

They also had an epic looking church.

Following the Folk Museum, we went to the Viking Museum. Once I stopped playing immigrant song
or repeat in my head (well, that's a lie, but once I stopped being too distracted by it) we saw
lots of cool artifacts, but the crowning glory was definitely the three viking longboats.

On the way to and from the museums, we were using Oslo's amazing public transportation services.
One thing I really liked was a series of political advertisements.

The text roughly translates to: "Don't let them take your voice, vote!"

We then went to see the [Vigeland Sculpture Park](https://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?TLp=181601).
Here's a couple of our photos, but look it up or click the link to see how many outlandish
sculptures of humanity in all its aspects rendered naked.

Finally, on our way out, I took a selfie with a bored looking girl in headphones.
She was pretty metal!
