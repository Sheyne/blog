So yesterday we got rained out (lightninged/hailed out really) from Pasochoa and
that didn't sit well with me. Today we were going to Sigchos to start hiking the
Quilotoa loop--a series of towns/hostels culminating in a lake in a volcanic
crater. We'll be hiking between the towns over a few days. But as I thought
about it, I realized we might have another shot at Pasochoa. The weather is best
in the morning, so as Mattie and I were sitting in front of the hostel I
suggested that that maybe we could get an "alpine start" and wake up at 4 am and
attempt it. Never to miss out on a summit, Mattie was in.

This morning was spectacular, bright stars till the sun poked over the horizon.
The summit was amazing with a beautiful view and we were a bit rushed on the way
down (we ran full tilt) but we made it only slightly late for breakfast and in
time for our shuttle to Sigchos.

Never to let things go smoothly, fate intervened and the road to Sigchos was
closed. Our transport managed to get us to Isinlivi which is the town we'd been
planning to walk to from Sigchos (and had already reserved a hostel in). After
our big hike this morning we were ready for a nap and the we did a little hike
in the town along a ridge that was very beautiful.
