We all got up a little after five. Daniel, Alissa, and I did, but also Meghan
and Lily which were less certain owing to the fact no one wants to wake up Lily.
We walked out to the point and watched the sun rise. I spent a lot of the time
with Lily on my lap and Mei got a cool time-lapse of Daniel, Alissa, and the
pink clouds. Strangely I wasn't closest to the cliff, but I was freaking my
niece's mother out enough as it was.
