We all got up a little after five. Daniel, Alissa, and I did, but also Meghan
and Lily which were less certain owing to the fact no one wants to wake up Lily.
We walked out to the point and watched the sun rise. I spent a lot of the time
with Lily on my lap and Mei got a cool time-lapse of Daniel, Alissa, and the
pink clouds. Strangely I wasn't closest to the cliff, but I was freaking my
niece's mother out enough as it was.

Later we drove up to Poli Poli and played disk golf and hiked around.

Then I met up with my mom and we went over to see Kanekoa. They played some of
their own amazing music, and did a bunch of great Pink Floyd tribute songs. They
often do tributes of various classic rock bands. I think this is a big part of
why my mom loves them so much. We watched the sunset with my aunt Paige first.
