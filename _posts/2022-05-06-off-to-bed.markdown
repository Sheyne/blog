It's 9pm and I'm off to sleep. Something crazy has happened to me and I've
turned into an adult. I'm trying to start work at 5:30am and end my day at
1:30pm so that I can make my morning standup meeting and also have sunlight in
the afternoon to spend time with friends and family. It's actually going well so
far, but we'll see how well it survives the weekend.

My last few days have been settling in well, having good work days at my mom's
house and spending time with my mom, my sister, my aunt River, and, of course,
Little Baby Lily! It took Lily several hours to remember who I am and that I'm
not too scary. I'm the cool uncle that will push her high on the swing, toss her
in the air, and let her ride on my shoulders. Initially she was very hesitant to
let me hold her which was sad. I've been doing my best to see her regularly to
avoid that. I guess I need to visit more. It's crazy to watch her develop. The
level of comprehension she displays as we talk to her is amazing. She's so much
more than a blob now. I can ask her questions and get a clear response. I need
to ask her questions or she'll be annoyed that I picked her up. Or that I didn't
pick her up, or a whole myriad of other ideas she wants to convey. Her new trick
is "dat". She can point at something and say "dat" and she means she wants the
thing, or to go see the thing.
