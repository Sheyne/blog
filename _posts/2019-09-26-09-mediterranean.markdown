Hello from the Z√ºrich--Gen√®ve train. I've just been visiting Kusi and Gabrielle
and their daughters, Celine, Am√®lie, and Cami. Kusi is an old friend of my parents
having met my dad in the early 90s (or maybe even a little earlier?) and I think
even living with them at some point.

Yesterday Kusi, Gabrielle and I went to Bern--"The Capital"--and checked out its
old town. We saw lots of cute shops, beautiful old buildings and, of course,
climbed the tower in the M√ºnster Cathedral.

I've been traveling just over a week now, having flown from Liverpool to Nice last
Wednesday. The trip has been a whirlwind. I started exploring Nice the night I flew
in. I walked along the Prom. des Anglais (the English Walk) which shows amazing
views of the C√¥te d'Azure even in the middle of the night. Sitting on the walk,
stir-fry in hand, looking at the rocks below the crystal clear waves, I finally
got a chance to catch up with Juju. She's decided that she's going to try to move
back to Salt Lake City. She thinks it should work out with work and she really
loves the city. That will be great for her, and make it easier to visit. Not that
I really make it to Salt Lake all that often.

The next morning I set about sightseeing in Nice. The C√¥te d'Azure is far more
beautiful in the daylight. One very cool landmark was the hill where an old ch√¢eau
had been. Its right on the coast with cliffs down to the water, offers views over
the port and over the old town, and has a huge fountain made to look like a waterfall.

Carrying on, I retrieved my backpack from the hostel and took the train for Monaco.
Monaco is really cool because the whole city of Monte Carlo is built terraced into
the hillside. Its pretty much impossible to avoid ocean views and the whole place is
pretty clean (its rich). People had a very kind laid back attitude at least from the
little I interacted with them. Every car stops for you when they see you at a cross-
walk, even sports cars. I spent some time sitting in the beautiful garden of INSERT
NAME HERE which overlooks the ocean and is next to the INSERT NAME OF OCEAN MUSEUM.
I did end up going into the casino to grab a drink, but I'm not sure it lived up to
the hype.

Since Monaco is such an expensive city, there was not a single hostel, so I carried
on to Genoa (Genova in Italian) that evening. At the hostel there I met some people
at "Sangria Night" which ended up being 3 of us drinking loads of Sangria and talking
about South American. They were both from there and I'm thinking I want to live
there a couple months next year. This was followed by a brief trip to the bars,
the wonderful novelty of beer on tap to go, and walking to the ocean.

The next day I explored the city of Genoa, and talked on the phone with Devinie who
I found out was in Rome. Unfortunately we couldn't quite make the timing work to see
each other. I found a hole-in-the-wall restaurant which a reviewer claimed was
where the locals go. I think they were right, the menus were beautiful italian but
hand written and out of the reach of translating them by taking a picture. I had
some of the best food of my whole trip. Two courses with wine for ‚Ç¨10. I was very
happy.

Next up, Milan. This city was crazy. Apparently its always fashion-focused, but
I went during Fashion Weekend. Whoops. The city was bustling with well dressed people.
The cheapest hostel was like ‚Ç¨50. People with fancy cameras were stopping traffic
(mostly foot traffic) to take pictures of models. I did have some very good real
italian pizza and dance to some music outside along the river. I tried, I really
did, to stay up long enough to go to a bar or something that night, but at 11:30p,
after three days of constant walking and stairs, I fled back to the hostel to
fall asleep.

The next day I explored Milano. They have fantastic public transport and the Duomo
is the most amazing cathedral I've ever been in. IT. IS. HUGE. I'm not quite sure
I can convey it. It's not that the building itself is enormous (although it is).
It's that the whole thing is one giant open space. The building is full of columns,
but not walls and the ceiling is the full height of the roof. The effect is
spectacular. Walking around on the roof was cool too. I was too crowded with people
and had limited access to sweeping city views. It was still well worth it.

From Milano, I took the train up to Lugano, a town on the Swiss/Italian border. The
Ticino Canton (Canton is somewhere between US state and county) has a very cool
pass for all people camping or staying at youth hostels. You automatically get
access to all public transport in the region for free. I didn't use it much because
Lugano was very walkable but it was nice to have.

I will speak more of Lugano and the rest of my time in Switzerland in a later post.
Hopefully. You know, like all the other posts I promised, like Oslo. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Thanks for reading,
