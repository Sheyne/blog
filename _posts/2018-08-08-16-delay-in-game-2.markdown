It looks like I can actually update my blog again. Something was going 
wrong with the way it was configured and I was trying to update posts
and failing. 

Here's a summary: 

I flew out to Maui to attend my dad's wedding. The first week I was there, my 
mom was visiting Kusi and Gabriella in Switzerland.

Maui was, as always, amazing. Although it was a bit rainy by summer
standards. This quite reasonably stressed out my dad and Annie because
they held their wedding outdoors in Haiku [where it always rains (spoiler
alert, it didn't rain))].

That first week I was out on Maui, Juju visited and we went up to the
crater with Vic and Nick.

I also went fishing with Vic and Nick. We almost caught something too.

Mei and I were commissioned by Annie to make a ring for my dad.

And the wedding was a ball. Here's a picture after the wedding because I
don't currently have any photos of the ceremony.

Next it was a quick flight to Utah for Daniel and Alissa's wedding. This
proved to be quite the ordeal and our plane had technical issues and we were
forced to make an emergency landing in Honolulu. Our added layover gave us
a chance to really mess up our sleep, but also to see Nalu and Roxane.

That flight was a chance to get some really fun stories, such as when
TSA asked Mei to take off her overshirt, Nick took off his shirt and scared
everyone. 

As a habitual procrastinator, I didn't buy the clothing Alissa had asked me
to wear as a groomsman until the last minute. I ended up going to 5 different
stores and calling several more trying to find pants that would fit my long,
skinny, frame. Here we are dressed up all nice though.

I should really have words to say about Mei's birthday, but this is turning into
a really long post. I will say we went skydiving for the first time and sang
a lot of amazing Karaoke. I hope to post better pictures and maybe even videos later.

Anyway, that's all for now. -Sheyne
