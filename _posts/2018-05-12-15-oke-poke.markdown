I’m not going to write this frequently for very long, I’m sure. But for now, I’m at a place, Oké Poké (note the incorrect accent on poke). The fish looks like it could well be good in spite of this mistake.

So the poke turned out to be pretty good. While I waited for my food I read an article about a chefs concerns about the rise of poke internationally. While some of his concerns were founded (I feel bad I ordered ahi, not salmon) it is definitely nice to be out here and affordably eat one of my favourite foods.
