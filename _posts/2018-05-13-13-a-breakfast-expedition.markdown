I woke up this morning and figured it would be a good idea to cook something 
else at home. I've cooked a pasta dish a couple of nights, and felt a little 
sick after eating it each time, so I want to figure out if its the pan, or
my ingredients. This was a good excuse to get out and check out some grocery 
stores.

First of all, the milk colors are all wrong. Blue is whole, green is partial skim, 
and red is full skim. Not one matches the US pattern. That said, my "fair price
for farmers" whole milk is delicious, better I think than in the states. 
I did get a bit gouged on the price, but part of the project for today was 
comparison shopping, so I bought a couple things from a few different stores.
I know which ones I'm probably not going to visit again and the second one, 
Sainsbury's Local, had much better milk prices.

Here's a picture for you dad, they've got the real stuff out here, I'll have
to try it on a later trip.
