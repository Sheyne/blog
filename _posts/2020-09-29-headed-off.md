I'm trying out blogging from my phone. It's not a 
particularly fancy technique, but it's somewhat silly
with my blog just being some markdown files I'm editing
on GitHub. I'm on the train to visit Juju. She wants
to go take a class on how to shoot a good and asked if
I'd like to go with her. I flew out from Santa Barbara
to see Brody get married and to canyoneer. I also 
had plans to do a Southern Utah camping trip with SB
folks, but due to unforeseen drama or complications, 
we're putting that on hold. 

What's most exciting is that I'm flying to Paris in
a couple weeks (in spite of the pandemic) to finally see
Nelly again. I'm going to have to schedule a COVID PCR
test for a day or two before flying so hopefully I have
my results at just the right time for arrival. This is
all contingent on consular approval, but we made it through
the initial screening for an exemption to the travel ban
so I had to buy a ticket before I could find out if
I will have the final approval. Wish me luck. 

Brody's wedding was gorgeous and fun. Seeing so many friends
(most at a safe distance) has been great as well.
