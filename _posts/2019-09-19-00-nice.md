Part of my plan for visiting Sean and Delia, was to also take some trips into
mainland Europe. I decided to do a just-over-a-week long trip from Nice to Geneva
without a commitment to the plan for the way to go in between but probably visiting
Monaco, Genoa, and Milan.

So, having taken the train from Manchester to Liverpool Airport (I got so close to
finally visiting Liverpool), I headed flew for Nice, France. I arrived late enough
at night that my train from the airport to city center was only running halfway.
This annoyance turned out to be a bonus, because I got to walk around the sea that first
night and, although I was stressed because I was going to be late checking in, the night
air was perfect and the seaside was lovely.

When I did make it to my hostel, I noticed that through the window on the stairs that
my shadow was being cast on a nearby building. I have the city a Shaka to say hi.

What follows are a series of photos from a hilltop in nice:

Having finished my Nice (har har) morning hike, I headed down the hill and went for a swim
in that perfect water. I'd left my towel at the hostel, so I just air-dried and walked to
the cathedral.
