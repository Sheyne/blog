I'm sitting on a train with Sean and Delia. We just flew into Torp airport and are
taking the train to Oslo. We're here in Norway for a quick weekend trip and I'm sure
I'll have plenty of pretty pictures to update but the end of it.

My plan for next week is to fly to Nice on Wednesday evening. I'll stay there a day
or two then head to Italy and up into Switzerland, flying from Geneva to Liverpool
on the 26th and taking a train back into Manchester to meet back up with Sean and Delia.
That weekend we'll take the train up to Edinburgh, where I might just see Andrew from
Santa Barbara.

The past couple weeks I've been staying with them at their lovely apartment in
Manchester. Last weekend we took a train to the city of Chester. Its a town that Sean
used to go to a lot as a kid. The whole of the city center (or at least the touristy
bit) was relatively car free.

While we were in Chester, we visited the cathedral.

They were doing a fundraiser to make repairs on the cathedral, and I thought their method
was rather clever. They were building a scale model of the cathedral, and you could add the
next brick for Â£1. Here's a picture of that model looking fairly complete, but apparently
around 100,000 bricks to go.

Later on we went to "Church", a bar in Chester built in an old church.
