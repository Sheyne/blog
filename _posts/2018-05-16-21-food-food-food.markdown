Tonight Mick (he's the guy who runs the office out here) took Cameron and I out for beers an dinner at this American food restaurant. Cameron is out here for the week setting up some systems for the new office out here. The restaurant was interesting because it had very exaggerated American food. We had tater tots with chilli, cheese, and sour cream on them, deep fried dough balls filled with mac and cheese, and bacon covered fries. I had a spicy burger with everything on it. Cameron's had two hamburger paddies and fried chicken on it. Without further ado, here are the glorious pictures:

Since Cameron is only out here for a week, we've been trying to go to quintessentially British places. For lunch yesterday we had fish-n-chips (also pretty yummy). In proper British fashion, I was served minted peas and and tea with my meal. I'm very happy with the brits, because they always take milk in their tea, which I think is delicious.

Finally, earlier this week we went for meat pies. They were also served with mint peas and were quite good, but I didn't take any pictures of them. The new dev intern, Sean, has been giving us a tour of Manchester and introducing us to British life.
