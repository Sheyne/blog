For the past couple months I have been embracing the full "tech nomad"
lifestyle. It was kicked off mainly by the imminent birth of my niece, Lily. So
lets pay the baby tax and start with that.

Here I am with Lily when I first met her, immediately after she came home with
Nick and Meghan from the hospital. As I wish (but doubt) you my dear future
reader has forgotten, all of this is happening during the 2020+ COVID-19
pandemic and I wasn't able to visit them at the hospital. My mom was allowed to
to be there with Nick and Meghan to support her delivery but after that policy
prevented her too from visiting them in the hospital.

Lily's birth served as a wonderful excuse to have a family reunion as we'd only
seen each other electronically for more than a year. Unfortunately I don't have
a whole lot of proof because apparently we only too pictures with about three of
us at a time.

Before heading out to connecticut, I went to Utah to visit Daniel, Alissa, Juju,
and others. As you can see in the above picture, Daniel and Alissa came out to
Connecticut to see Meghan, Nick, and Lily too. So lets step back in time and
show off some pictures.
