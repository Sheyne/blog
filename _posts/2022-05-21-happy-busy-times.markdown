The last couple weeks were really great. Mattie was out here for 10 days and we
worked from 5:30 - 1ish pretty much every day. After that we were free to
explore the island. We had a great many adventures, from surfing with my dad to
lounging in luxury with Daniel and Alissa to hiking with my mom to getting stuck
in a closed off cave with Nick. All though we spent time with Lily and Meghan.
