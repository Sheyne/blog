Afterwards we drove up into the mountains, to a small town called Mascioni. Here
we stayed at the nicest little hotel (Locanda Mausonium) with a very sweet host.
We were in a tiny town next to a beautiful lake with snowy mountains in the
background. The man from the hotel cooked us dinner and I had a nice carafe of
wine and great food.

The next day we truly drove up truly into the mountains. Since the funicular
wasn't running we drove the long way round to a high plateau with a hostel and
indulged in Italian coffee for Nelly and a beer for me.
