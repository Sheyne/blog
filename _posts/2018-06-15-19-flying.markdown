**I'll upload the pictures that go with this post soon. Wanted to get it up now**

It's been a month since my last post, so I guess that means that I've been in Manchester 
more than a month now. Wow the time has flown, and stagnated. Right now I'm sitting 
in seat 34C on LZ381 to Zürich. I'm visiting Kusi and his family, my parents have been friends 
him since before I was born and I have some fond early memories spending time with his family. 
I have clearer ones of him visiting us in Salt Lake, although that must have been 10 years 
ago. 

At some point I'll try to retcon in a post with a bunch of pictures of my time thus far in Manchester. 
For now suffice it to say that I haven't left city center much. A week or two ago Kyle and I 
took the train down to London to represent Novacoast at the BSides security conference while 
Mick and some other Novacoasters attended another conference. While in London I did get a chance 
to take the tube

and to see Hyde park.

Speaking of the train, Sean suggested I take the train to the Manchester airport. This turned into a 
comedy of errors. The first train I was going to take was canceled due to a malfunction, the next
one was delayed and finally re-routed to not go to the airport, a third was canceled at which point 
I met some other people headed to the airport we decided spilt a cab. Fortunately I did make my 
flight. Remarkably, while trying to find a taxi I met not one but two different people on the same 
flight as me. 

In terms of Manchester adventures, I've burnt through all six of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn books,
gone to a fair number of pubs including visiting a Murder Mystery improv show. The entirety of the
show was either randomized or audience selected which made for a terribly fun experience. The 
bit where we as an audience were supposed to figure out the murderer was a bit lacking though.

I'm enjoying the fact that the airline is serving a good sandwich with proper cheese, and a side of
complementary wine while I write this post. 

While I'm in Zürich I'll make an effort to post pictures of my adventures. 

That's all for now,
