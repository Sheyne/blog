Hi everyone,

Its been a long time since we've talked. Well since I've talked and you read.
Since my last post I've spent several weeks in Connecticut with my sister and
her family, visited Santa Barbara and all the folks there, had a lovely
Christmas in Utah, got COVID and saw friends (family) in Sun Valley, and overall
just imposed way too much on my cool friends and had an alltogether good time.
Here is a huge dump of photos. I'll try to knock out a post with some of the
things I've been up to with more prose and less photos next.

Here's some photos from Connecticut, both hiking and at the museum at Yale.

I also visited Shane and Sara in Philly, but the only photo I have with them is
them thanking my sister for all the nice baby things she sent with me to give
them.

Once I got to Utah I went hiking with Daniel, Alissa, and their dog Bernie.

We cooked an elaborate Friendsgiving feast. Count on Andrew to make us do
everything the right way and not cut any corners.

Back in Utah with magic Jew Glasses that turn any light source into a Star of
David for Hanukkah.

their new back yard.
