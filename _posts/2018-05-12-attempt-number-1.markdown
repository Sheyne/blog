I’m here in Manchester England for the summer. I just stopped in at the office to charge my phone, because chargers have been the biggest unexpected driver pain so far. See the British have these weird bulky plugs they’re very proud of, but it means that most of my wall warts don’t work. That means it’s pretty easy to forget one thing or another and not be able to charge my phone. 

Gripes about chargers aside, everyone has been super welcoming and the city itself is really cool. Here’s the view from my desk:

(You can see the nonsense plugs at the bottom)

The office is a short walk from my house, just long enough that it doesn’t seem like I can just pop over, but close enough it doesn’t feel like a pain. I’ll get back to you as to whether that’s the way I like things, but it’s good for now. 

I’m going to try to find the Alan Turing memorial now, the internet thinks picking a goal (and then deviating from it) is the best way to see a new city.
