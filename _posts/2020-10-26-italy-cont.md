Napoli was something else. I can even begin to put it down. It was packed with
people. It had a thriving nightlife. The press of human bodies moving around the
streets on foot, moped, and by car felt 3rd worldly in a way that I'd never
experienced before. Naples made driving in Rome feel like driving back in the US
by comparison. Cars pulling out in front of you, mopeds appearing from every
corner, ahead, behind, parking anywhere, running lights, ignoring cops. It was
insanity. And I think I learned several valuable lessons about driving under
pressure. I only stalled a few times. Admittedly that probably should have been
zero.

The next day was spent mostly at a very cool museum. We saw spectacular ancient
sculptures, mosaics from Pompeii, and beautiful paintings. It was really nice to
have an incredibly knowledgeable guide whom I could bombard with questions.

That afternoon we drove to Sorrento. We managed to stay in this fantastic hotel
on the water, presumably because everything was empty for COVID.

The next morning I swam in the Mediterranean which was as gorgeous and clear as
it was last year in Nice, although not as warm and sunny. Following this we
drove along the Amalfi coast and I did a hike (or at least part of a hike)
called Sentiero degli Dei (the path of the gods).

After a lovely meal and some nice desserts in Amalfi, we headed inland and drove
back to Rome. On the way we had a gorgeous view of Vesuvius. Parking in Rome
was a bit of a challenge, but overall it was pretty straight forward to get
checked in. The next day I fully embraced tourism while Nelly got caught up on
some work.

Finally we drove to the airport and flew home to Paris.
