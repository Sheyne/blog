I just watched this video on youtube ([youtube.com/watch?v=KAo2nmVlfOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAo2nmVlfOA))
and it got me thinking about my blog. I've been playing around with the idea of posting on here more and trying to
spend a bit more time reflecting on what I'm thinking and feeling rather than just talking about experiences I've had.
Part of the thought for me is to use this platform as an opportunity for growth. I think I should take some time
to reflect on what Facebook, this blog, and various other social media mean for me.

In the early days of this blog, it was the only place I was posting pictures from my life. Then I got a request
from my friend Trevor that I post some pictures of Europe (to social media). I got a lot more likes than I'd been
used to getting in the past. I don't know if that contributed to the decline in the blog. I think the biggest thing is
that, paradoxically, more stuff was going on in my life and that meant I was less inclined to post here. The other thing
is the instant feedback, I can immediately tell if a bunch of people saw a Facebook post, it'll get some likes, here
I didn't know if anyone's actually even reading my posts. That's a big part of the desirability of the blog. I can write
about stuff I don't particularly want to broadcast to all my vague acquaintances. Having just been on Maui for a month
to visit everyone for Christmas I got a chance to talk to Yenna and Greg, the two people I often visualize when I write
this blog and got the feedback that they do check it. That, coupled with the the intrinsic value I get from the act of
of organizing my thoughts in this format should keep me going.

I'm finding it way harder to stay on topic with this generally reflective blog post. I'm thinking about all the life
stories I want to talk about, my adventures over the past few months, and thinking about how no-one is going to want
to read a nonsensical stream-of-consciousness. So lets add that to the list of goals: a) get better at writing via
blogging, and b) have a coherent narrative for each blog post.

I'm curious if I can use Facebook/Instagram "socially" in the sense of the linked-to YouTube video. For him that would mean:

1. Don't arrange a situation just to post it
2. Don't take myself out of the moment to take a picture
3. Focus more on sharing with friends and family than optimizing for likes

Additionally he makes the point about the "tyranny of the future self". I thought this was an interesting point and
it might be an accessability issue. I never used to go back through photos I'd taken but now that I've started to keep
everything in Google Photos and everything is easily searchable I can pull from my own photos more easily than a google
search when I want to tell people about something I've done or somewhere I've been. I read this article
[design.google/library/ux-ai](https://design.google/library/ux-ai/) the other day and it makes a great point about the
level of seamlessness it takes to make something useful to people. I think Apple Photos and Google Photos are hitting a
threshold with their facial recognition and content aware searching that the way we review old photos we've taken is
going take a dramatic turn.

Side-note: I'm stopping myself from going into it, but I've been thinking a lot lately about wanting a non-centralized
option for many of my cloud serviced. I'd love a self-hosted google photos and full mail suite with gmail level UI.
I don't think it exists right now. I suppose this isn't so off topic because I really want a decentralized facebook too.
That was part of the original motivation for this blog.

Anyway, for now my only action items (boy I sound like a engineering consultant) for myself are to think more consciously
about my social media habits so I can collect information for later decisions on social media and to post to this blog more
often.
