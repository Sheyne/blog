Okay, so I haven't **posted** in a long, long, time. I also haven't written a blog post in a while,
but the grievous error was probably leaving that last one written and just unposted. In my defense, 
I did have a bit of a hectic month. Here are some highlights, my flight-schedule looked like the following: 

<img alt="screenshot of my flights in google inbox" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/flights.png" width="300px"/>

Which missing the first flight MAN->BOS and which google hilariously sees as a single trip with layovers and
labels as "Trip from Boston to Salt Lake City". My Dad is also getting married next week so I've taken most of 
the month off to be on Maui, but I fly the day after his wedding to Utah because Daniel Amsel and Alissa are
getting married two days later. Throw in Dev All-Hands in Santa Barbara in mid July and it's just been a crazy
month.

To be continued...
