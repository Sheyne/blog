I'm writing this from Bailey's (Alex) place in Bremerton (an hour ferry from Seattle).
Jared came out and visited me in Santa Barbara last week and he was flying up to visit
Bailey afterwards and I decided to come too.

Yesterday we had a fun day walking around Seattle and visiting the MoPOP (the pop
culture) museum. We saw our friend sam and checked out the Space Needle. Sam works for
Google, so he showed us the outside of the new campus they're working on.

I am now continuing this blog post, sitting on a ferry in the San Juan islands. The
islands are in the channel between Vancouver Island and the Olympic Peninsula. I've
been getting very used to ferry use since we'd been using it every day to get into
Seattle. We've also now used it to go from Anacortes to San Juan Island to Orcas
Island. Orcas Island (and the San Juans as a whole) is absolutely stellar.

The plan for tonight is to take another ferry across to the northern tip of the Olympic
Peninsula, try to find somewhere to camp, then explore Olympic National Park tomorrow.
Hopefully Alex finally isn't working and he can come up and hike with us.

While we've been camping, I've been using a rented sleeping bag which comes with a
liner, basically a sleeping bag sheet. Here's me wearing it the right way, and a photo
of what it's like to wake up in a tent around these parts.

Sunday I'll fly to Manchester and see Sean and Delia when I land Monday morning. I
should really apologize to them because I've been winging this trip so much they've
had essentially no idea when I was coming.

This trip is starting to make me think about the feeling of impermanence that comes
with not making anywhere a home. I have my driver's license which lists Sue's house
in Ogden and Yenna's and each of my parents' homes on Maui each of which feel like
home. None of these are places where I live these days though. The problem that I
hadn't anticipated is that living impermanently is a state of mind that I need to
actively combat. Things like trying to make lasting friendships in spite of not
feeling like I'm going to stay some where particularly long. These last few months
in Santa Barbara have included a sort of self-imposed isolation. "I have _______,
but it's in Utah" has been a typical refrain. I'll try to explore this theme some
more later, but I'm making an effort to actually finish one of these posts, and the
ferry is coming up on harbor.

Thanks for reading,

Sheyne
